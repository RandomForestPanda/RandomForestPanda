# Hi, I'm Vamshi Vishruth 👋

🎓 CSE Student @ PES University | 

I enjoy crafting intelligent systems — from **RAG-based assistants** and **serverless compute platforms** to **deep learning for vision** and **reinforcement learning agents for ecological simulations**.  
Currently exploring **LLM fine-tuning (LoRA/QLoRA)**, **adaptive trading models**, and **autonomous robotics**.
